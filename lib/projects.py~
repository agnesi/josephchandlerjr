IssueTrackerDescription = """ This project will be developed in Django. Eventually a demo will be available on this website.
A brief description of the specs follows.

A company needs to assess the security of vendors or internal departments, identify risks, manage those risks and eventually 
resolve them by implementing a risk mitigation plan or, if the risk is negligible, through a risk acceptance process.  

Each identified risk results in the creation of an issue.  Issues will have the following components:
-risk
-risk rating
-date of risk identification
-recommendation
-recommended target date (deadline for mitigation or remediation)
initial response from vendor or department with risk may take the following forms
-if the dept. or vendor agrees with the risk
-mitigation or remediation plan
-target date of plan to be implemented
-actions taken to close the risk and evidence showing that it has been addressed
if the dept. or vendor disagrees with risk
-reason as to why risk rating should be reduced or why the risk should be closed
-clarification or evidence showing that risk was identified in error
-follow up to vendor or department response
